"""E4 — Self-consistency vote on high-stakes claims (ENHANCEMENT_PLAN E4, P1).

Denny Zhou: self-consistency lifts accuracy 58→75% by sampling N answers and
selecting the most cross-supported one (universal self-consistency for open-ended).
DISTINCT from triple-draft (which MERGES 3 angle drafts; this VOTES).

The high-effort lane only: for `effort=high` (or an explicitly contested claim),
sample N host-model judgments on a high-stakes (claim, quote) pair and apply
universal self-consistency — the host model picks the most cross-supported verdict.
Keyless (host model via the LLMProvider seam, N calls — costs tokens, no key). The
default (non-high) effort path is UNCHANGED: no extra calls.
